## Calendar File Status

The `calendar.html` file has been stripped down to include only the essential calendar elements. All unrelated or extraneous content has been removed, leaving a minimal version focused solely on the calendar functionality and UI. This makes the file easier to maintain and integrate into the extension or web application.
