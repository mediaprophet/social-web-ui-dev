## Blog File Status

The `blog` component has been updated to include only the basic components necessary for core functionality. All advanced or legacy features have been removed, resulting in a simplified and maintainable structure.

**Note:** Consider whether the name `blog` is still appropriate for this component. If its purpose is now more general (e.g., writing, note-taking, or content creation), a new name such as `write` or something similar may be more suitable.
